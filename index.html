      <h2>Are Drivers Ignoring the Risk of Mobile Phones?</h2>
      <p>Over the past 15 years, fines for mobile phone use while driving have increased sharply. But does that mean drivers are changing their habits? This data story explores trends in enforcement, technology, and behaviour to uncover what the numbers really say about road safety.</p>
      <p>Mobile phone use while driving remains a dangerous and persistent behaviour in Australia. This dashboard explores enforcement data from 2008 to 2023 to help us understand the effectiveness of current strategies and spark conversation on what still needs to be done.</p>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>A Sharp Rise After 2020</h3>
  <p>There was a significant increase in the number of fines issued starting in 2020. This correlates with the rollout of fixed and mobile phone detection cameras across jurisdictions, particularly in NSW. These technologies dramatically improved detection rates without increasing physical police presence.</p>
  <figure>

    <figcaption><em>Figure 1: Annual mobile phone fines showing a clear rise after 2020.</em></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>What unfolds in this visual is not just a simple spike, it’s a structural shift in enforcement. The quiet consistency before 2020 is disrupted by a wave of camera-issued fines, revealing the moment policy met powerful technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <h3>The Role of Technology</h3>
  <p>In 2020 alone, nearly 139,000 fines were issued due to automated camera enforcement. These systems allow for high-volume enforcement, but the question remains: does this lead to better compliance or just better detection?</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="assets/imgs/barcchart_mobile_camera-2020-total-fines.png" alt="Camera fines 2020" />
    <figcaption><em>Figure 2: Bar chart showing camera fines spiking in 2020.</em></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Here, we witness a pivotal moment. Enforcement became scalable and near-invisible. This isn’t just about more fines, it’s about how enforcement moved from the roadside to the algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <h3>Manual Enforcement is Declining</h3>
  <p>In contrast to automated systems, police-issued fines have been dropping. This could be due to reduced patrols, shifting resources, or the increased reliance on digital enforcement infrastructure.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="assets/imgs/linechart_police-issue_2019-2020-going-down.png" alt="Police fines drop" />
    <figcaption><em>Figure 3: Decline in police-issued fines post-2019.</em></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>As shown above, the presence of police on the road is no longer the front line. While this may enhance efficiency, it raises questions about deterrence, discretion, and the human role in road safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <h3>Jurisdictional Comparison</h3>
  <p>NSW dominates in terms of total fines. The state has embraced mobile detection cameras and maintains dual data streams via police and revenue departments. This results in more consistent and aggressive enforcement compared to other jurisdictions.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="assets/imgs/donutchart_mobile_camera-2023-NSW.png" alt="Fines by state" />
    <figcaption><em>Figure 4: NSW leads in mobile phone fines issued in 2023.</em></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The breakdown of state enforcement reveals how policy, funding, and strategy vary dramatically. NSW’s dominance isn't just statistical, it’s a reflection of deeper commitment to detection and follow-through.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <h3>Behavioural Challenge</h3>
  <p>Despite more enforcement, detection continues to rise. This raises serious questions about whether fines alone are enough to change behaviour. The trend suggests a cultural resistance to compliance, where the risk of being caught is accepted as part of driving.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="assets/imgs/linechart_mobile-camera_2020_year.png" alt="Detection trends" />
    <figcaption><em>Figure 5: Continued rise in mobile detections despite enforcement efforts.</em></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>What we see here isn’t decline — it’s revelation. Despite increasing chances of being fined, the behaviour persists. This suggests the presence of cameras is failing to compete with the lure of instant phone access.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <h3>Enforcement Overview</h3>
  <p>The summary cards highlight the dominance of camera-based fines and the scale of mobile phone violations across all jurisdictions. The sheer volume of detections underlines the fact that distracted driving is still a nationwide issue.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="assets/imgs/summary-all-data.png" alt="Summary cards" />
    <figcaption><em>Figure 6: Summary of mobile phone enforcement totals.</em></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In a single glance, we grasp the scope and imbalance of current enforcement strategies. These figures aren't just summaries, they are signals that our response remains uneven, fragmented, and reactive.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <h3>What Can Be Done?</h3>

    <p>Fines and detection alone cannot stop risky driving. To make real change, we must go beyond enforcement. These camera systems catch more drivers, but are they creating safer roads — or just more fines?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>National consistency:</strong> Align reporting and enforcement policies between all states.</li>
      <li><strong>Education programs:</strong> Promote behaviour change through awareness campaigns and training.</li>
      <li><strong>Positive reinforcement:</strong> Offer rewards for safe driving, like insurance discounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Warning-first strategies:</strong> Trial systems that notify first-time offenders before penalising.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Mobile phone use while driving is still prevalent despite years of enforcement. The data reveals our systems can detect offences — but we now need broader strategies to reduce them. The goal must shift from punishment to prevention.</p>
