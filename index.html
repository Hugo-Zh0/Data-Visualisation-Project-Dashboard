    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section>
        <p>
            Despite rising awareness, legislative efforts, and evolving detection technology, mobile phone use behind the wheel remains a stubborn and persistent issue across Australia’s roads. Our dashboard doesn’t just visualise data — it invites readers to question whether our current enforcement strategies are truly working.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a story told through 15 years of enforcement data. It’s a story for road safety analysts looking to uncover patterns, for policymakers seeking to drive change, for law enforcement reflecting on operational effectiveness, and for everyday Australians wondering: <em>Why does this problem still exist?</em>
        </p>

        <h2>To the Analyst: Dig Deeper Than the Numbers</h2>
        <p>
            You’re no stranger to the data — you thrive on it. But what if the very patterns we’re used to seeing carry deeper insight? The dashboard offers you more than just annual fine counts. You can dissect trends by detection method, observe state-by-state performance normalised by licence holders, and filter down to specific jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll quickly notice anomalies — jurisdictions with unusually high fines, others with plateaus, and some with sudden spikes. Why did camera-based detections suddenly rise in certain years? How did enforcement in Queensland compare to Victoria during COVID periods? The data lets you follow these trails — and uncover the answers.
        </p>

    <!-- Policymaker Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>To the Policymaker: What’s the Real Impact of Enforcement?</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard presents a confronting truth: despite more fines and better tech, driver behaviour may not be changing fast enough. The line charts show enforcement increasing — especially through camera-based systems — but mobile phone-related incidents haven’t disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bar chart displaying fines per 10,000 licence holders reveals an uncomfortable reality: some states are underperforming. When you compare this against detection methods, questions arise. Are fines high due to better detection, or due to worse compliance? Is it time for a national strategy?
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool isn’t just informational — it’s decision-supporting. Use the downloadable datasets, investigate state-level policy differences, and identify where reform might be most urgently needed.
        </p>

    <!-- Enforcement Officer Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>To the Enforcement Officer: Does the Data Reflect the Frontline?</h2>
        <p>
            You see what happens on the roads every day. But how does your work compare with the rest of the country? Are your efforts part of a broader pattern — or the outlier?
        </p>
        <p>
            The dashboard enables comparison between police-issued and camera-issued fines. If your state shows a dip in police-issued fines while camera detections rise, what does that say about deployment strategies? Are there gaps in on-the-ground enforcement? Has your role shifted from deterrence to documentation?
        </p>
        <p>
            And what about fairness? Are fines being issued evenly, or are there discrepancies by remoteness or age group (where data is available)? This tool is a mirror — one that reflects the patterns behind the procedures.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Public Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>To the Public: What Story Do the Fines Tell?</h2>
        <p>
            To the concerned parent, the road safety advocate, or the curious citizen: this dashboard empowers you. You don’t need to be a data scientist to understand what’s happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simple colour-coded charts, summary cards, and interactivity let you explore your state’s performance, compare jurisdictions, and see whether things are improving. The donut chart lets you grasp — in seconds — how most fines are detected. Hover and click through the years and watch the story unfold: a surge of enforcement here, a dip there, a new technology implemented, a campaign launched.
        </p>
        <p>
            But most importantly, you’ll ask yourself: <em>why are we still struggling to stop phone use while driving?</em> And that question — that reflection — is what turns data into impact.
        </p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>The Final Message: More Than a Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
            This dashboard isn’t just about enforcement numbers. It’s about what those numbers represent — lives, behaviours, habits, risks. It’s about transparency, accountability, and above all, change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you’re crafting policy, analysing outcomes, enforcing the law, or simply trying to drive home safely, this story belongs to all of us. It asks us to consider not just what we’re doing — but whether it’s enough.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Because the fines keep rising. But so do the risks.</strong></p>
