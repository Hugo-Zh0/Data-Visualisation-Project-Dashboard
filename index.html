    <h2>Are Drivers Ignoring the Risk of Mobile Phones? A Decade of Fines Tells the Story</h2>
    <p>
      For more than a decade, Australian authorities have issued a growing number of fines for mobile phone use while driving.
      The message has been clear: distracted driving is dangerous and illegal. Yet, the question remains:
      <strong>Are drivers listening?</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>A Sharp Rise After 2020</h3>
    <p>
      From 2020 onwards, mobile phone fines surged across the country. This coincides directly with the introduction of
      <strong>mobile phone detection cameras</strong> in jurisdictions like New South Wales.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <h3>The Role of Technology in Detection</h3>
    <p>
      Mobile cameras became a major contributor to fines beginning in 2020. One single detection method accounted for nearly 139,000 fines that year alone.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <h3>Manual Enforcement in Decline</h3>
    <p>
      While camera fines have grown, police-issued fines have steadily dropped. From 2019 onwards, the data shows a clear and consistent decline.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <h3>Which States Are Issuing the Most Fines?</h3>
    <p>
      When we look at state-based breakdowns, New South Wales clearly dominates in the number of mobile phone fines issued.
      This donut chart for 2023 shows NSW far ahead of other jurisdictions, such as QLD, VIC, and TAS.
    </p>

      <figcaption><em>Figure 4: Donut chart showing fines distribution by state. NSW leads significantly.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Enforcement is Rising, But Is It Enough?</h3>
    <p>
      If drivers continue using their phones despite increasing fines and detection, the issue may run deeper than enforcement.
      This is not just a legal challenge — it may be a cultural one.
    </p>

    <h3>Summarising the Bigger Picture</h3>
    <p>
      This summary view gives us the totals at a glance. It shows the volume of fines by camera and police detection,
      revealing not just how much enforcement has occurred — but how heavily it now relies on automation.
    </p>

    <h3>What Can Be Done?</h3>
    <p>
      The story told by this data is clear: enforcement is growing, but the behaviour isn't stopping. This suggests that fines alone are not enough.
      So what comes next?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Improve national consistency:</strong> Some states underreport data (e.g. Victoria), and others use proxies (e.g. ACT). A national framework for mobile phone detection reporting could improve comparisons and help develop unified strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Target education, not just punishment:</strong> Public campaigns must go beyond awareness — they need to challenge attitudes about distraction, just as past campaigns reframed drink driving.</li>
      <li><strong>Use data to guide behaviour change:</strong> Instead of only issuing fines, jurisdictions could pilot warning-first systems that alert drivers caught once, educating them before penalising.</li>
      <li><strong>Incentivise good behaviour:</strong> Rewarding clean records (via insurance discounts or road-use rewards) could introduce positive reinforcement, not just penalties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Enforcement has come a long way, but technology alone cannot shift human behaviour. For that, we need deeper social solutions, clear national collaboration, and systems that prioritise both prevention and accountability.
    </p>

    <h3>A Final Thought</h3>
    <p>
      Behind every number in this dashboard is a choice made by a driver — and a chance to prevent future harm.
      As the data shows, the problem isn’t invisibility anymore. It’s impact. The question is no longer “Can we detect it?” — but “Can we stop it?”
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion: A Data Story with a Warning</h3>
    <p>
      This decade of data tells us something important: enforcement has evolved, but behaviour has not.
      Cameras are now watching more than ever before, and yet, thousands of drivers are still being caught every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fines may be growing — but so is the problem. If behaviour doesn’t change, technology alone won’t solve it.
