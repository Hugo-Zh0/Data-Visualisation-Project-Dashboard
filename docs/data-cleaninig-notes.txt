Data Cleaning Notes for Mobile Phone Usage Fines Dataset
Prepared by: Hugo
Date: 13/04/2025

1. Data Source
---------------
Original dataset obtained from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport (2023), compiled from various state and territory police agencies. The data includes monthly enforcement records, fines, charges, arrests, and detection methods.

2. Tools Used
---------------
Data was processed using KNIME Analytics Platform. The KNIME workflow applied includes:
- File Reader node (CSV input)
- Row Filter
- Group By for summarisation
- Column Filter
- String Manipulation
- Missing Value Handler

3. Cleaning Objectives
-----------------------
Focus on mobile phone non-compliance fines only  
Prepare data for accurate year-by-year jurisdictional comparison  
Ensure uniform formatting and field naming for visualisation

4. Key Transformations & Filters
---------------------------------
Filtered rows to keep only records related to "Mobile Phone Non-Compliance Fines"  
Removed rows with missing or null jurisdiction/state values  
Replaced "Unknown" or blank detection method values with "Other"  
Combined 'Fines' and 'Charges' where fines were unavailable (e.g., ACT, QLD)  
Converted all date fields to YYYY-MM format where applicable  
Ensured consistency in 'Jurisdiction' naming (e.g., "New South Wales" vs "NSW")  
Merged multiple detection method categories into simplified types: "Police", "Camera", "Other"

5. Fields Removed
------------------
- Arrest-related columns (not applicable to mobile phone offences)
- Drug and breath test columns
- Fields with >80% missing values

6. Data Limitations & Notes
----------------------------
ACT uses "Charges" instead of fines as a proxy  
VIC does not provide fines/charges — detection-only  
TAS has missing data for 2020–2022  
NT 2023 data is incomplete  
NSW includes both police- and camera-issued fines, potentially inflating totals  

These limitations are accounted for in visual annotations and documentation on the dashboard.

7. Output
----------
Final cleaned dataset saved as:
`cleaned_data_police_enforcement.csv`

This dataset is used for all D3.js visualisations in the dashboard.
